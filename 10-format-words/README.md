## Kata 10 - Reformat words in a sentence

This kata was a little more complex. It takes an argument that is an array of words, and must return those words as a string separated by commas except for the last which is separated by 'and'. For example, ['apple', 'guava', 'pear', blueberry'] returns 'apple, guava, pear and blueberry'. This sounded easier than it was and was also made harder accounting for empty and null arrays.
