## Day 3 - Insert Dashes

The goal of this challenge was to take a number and return a string of that number with dashes inserted between instances of two odd numbers. This could have been accomplished with regular expressions, but I did it the long way by creating a string, looping through it and keeping track of the indices where dashes should be inserted, and then using the splice method to insert the dashes.
